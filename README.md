# Diabetes Prediction System

### Overview
This project is a machine learning system that predicts whether a person is diabetic based on specific medical features using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

---

### Features
- Preprocessed data with `StandardScaler`.
- Classified data using a linear SVM.
- Evaluated model accuracy on training and test datasets.
- Developed a simple predictive system for real-time predictions.

---

### Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). It includes the following features:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (0: Non-diabetic, 1: Diabetic)
